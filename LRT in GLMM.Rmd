## Introduction
To discuss past improvements of the likelihood ratio test... 
our own work on alternatives...
then likelihood bootstrap-based tests in GLMM... quasillikelihood (link to MMRM), bias using this in LRT? ... marginal effects in GLMM can be done by MCLikelihood...
application in the discussion between LMM versus MMRM... conditional versus marginal estimation in GLMM...

Aplication to big problems: galton frankStein particle - simulation based approaches for GLMM... discuss nuisance parameters, missing data, random (unobservable) variables (longitudinal+spatial)... finite sample???


We denote here generalised linear models (GLM) for unit-level data 
$(y_u, \boldsymbol{x}_u)$, for a $y_u$ outcome variable and $\boldsymbol{x}_u$ 
the vector of covariates for unit $u$, the Exponential family of functions. 
Denote the probability (mass or density) distribution in the form
$$ f(y_u, x_u; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \exp \left\{  \right\}$$
... Analysis of Categorical Data for Complex Surveys, Skinner (2018)...
The GLMM we denote by...

he same point estimator is typically natural for both βN and β and is often called the pseudo MLE (Skinner, 1989)


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(lme4)
library(arm)
library(RColorBrewer)

##### work on model comparison using bootMer ##### simulate some data and fit a
##### random intercept model to them
x <- runif(100, 0, 10)
# the grouping variable
site <- gl(n = 10, k = 10)
# the random intercept effect, the simulated standard deviation around the
# intercept is 1
rnd <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)
# the simulated resposne variable, note that the fixed effect coefficient
# are 1 for the intercept and 3 for the slope. Also the simulated residuals
# will have a standard deviation of one
y <- rep(1 + rnd, each = 10) + 3 * x + rnorm(100, 0, 1)
# fit the model using Maximum Likelihood to be able to use the LRT
m1 <- lmer(y ~ x + (1 | site), REML = FALSE)

# simulate to generate credible intervals
simu <- sim(m1, n.sims = 1000)
# a new model matrix with ordered and equally spaced predictor values
new.x <- model.matrix(~x, data = data.frame(x = seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)))
new.y <- matrix(ncol = 1000, nrow = 100)
# get the predicted response values for each 1000 simulations of the fixed
# effect model parameters
new.y <- apply(simu@fixef, 1, function(x) new.x %*% x)
# compute the lower/upper quantile
lower <- apply(new.y, 1, function(x) quantile(x, prob = 0.025))
upper <- apply(new.y, 1, function(x) quantile(x, prob = 0.975))
median <- apply(new.y, 1, function(x) quantile(x, prob = 0.5))

# nice plot
pal <- brewer.pal(10, "RdYlBu")
plot(y ~ x, col = rep(pal, each = 10), pch = 16)
lines(new.x[, 2], median, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
lines(new.x[, 2], lower, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
lines(new.x[, 2], upper, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

How to build a GLMM to combine economic/wealth, health, demographic, politics, social media... and explain the outbreaks of protests around the world?

Why economists get things wrong... they are like a marginal model where the most assumption is profit increasing month after month... but conditional models on measures out of economics box could help to explain government performances... individual and aggregated info... to link with dynamic models and relation to quantum theories...
