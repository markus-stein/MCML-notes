* In one of the messages popping-up when accessing my Uni's website, the headline says (in portuguese):
    + "To use mask correctly reduce in about 87% the risk of getting the virus".
* The study is a case-control survey, very well conducted by researchers in epidemiology from the key Universities of our state and council health board.
    + Lancet pre-print paper !["Social Distancing, Mask Use and the Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A Population-Based Case-Control Study"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3731445)
    + Are we able to say the hadline from this case-control study?
* Can masks by themselves decrease the risks covid-19?
    + physics and chemistry... how droplets travel in the air with and without masks... for how long it stays... 
    + type of masks... viral load exposed... charcarteristics of the location of contat...
* I am not saying that the study is unaccurate to say that.... case-control survey is higly recommended in studies of such kind. 
* We also can improve analisys by ...

...
* Should this be better to say that "...the habit of wearing masks reduce..."
    + is the habit of wearing masks confounded with other habits that people more succeptible to wear masks also do?
